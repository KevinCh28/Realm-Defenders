<p>Monsters has made their way to your village. Pick up your weapons and protect your home!</p>
<p>Inspired by plant vs zombies</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>1. Monsters will appear on the right side of the screen. Be prepared to defend against them.</p>
<p>2. If any monsters reach the left side of the screen, the game will end in a loss. Be vigilant in protecting your village.</p>
<p>3. To defend against the monsters, place villagers on the screen by clicking on an open spot. The villagers will shoot projectiles towards the right side of the screen to defeat the monsters. It is recommended to place them on the far left side as they are fragile.</p>
<p>4. Keep track of your resources, as each villager requires 100 resources to place. Defeating monsters will earn you 50 resources to use for future placements.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>Projectile and monster collisions, as well as monster and villager collisions. Both villagers and monsters have health points and will be removed from the game once they reach zero. </p>
<p>The game board has a grid-like setup and the defender can be placed on any empty spot. </p>
<p>Projectiles will be generated at regular intervals from the defender's position. </p>
<p>The game's difficulty will increase as the player's highscore or playtime increases. </p>

<h2>Future Developments</h2>
<p>1) Implementing the ability to upgrade units.</p>
<p>2) Adding a sound effect for when units collide.</p>
<p>3) Programming units to only fire projectiles when a monster is detected in the same row, and incorporating different idle animations for them.</p>
<p>4) Incorporating a death animation for all units when their hit points reach zero.</p>
